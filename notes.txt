Episode 2:




What is package.json file ?
- Configuration file for the project.
- It contains the information about the project and the dependencies.
- It is used to install the dependencies and the packages for the project.

What is package-lock.json file?
- This keeps track of the exact version of the dependencies that are installed in the node_modules folder.
- This is a very important file for the project.

node_modules folder:
- This gets created when we do npm install.
- npm i fetches all the data we requested and puts it into the node_modules folder.
- node_modules is a very heavy folder.


Should we commit node_modules folder to the repository?
- No, we should not commit node_modules folder to the repository.
- We should commit package.json and package-lock.json files to the repository.
- Always put node_modules folder in the .gitignore file.
- package-lock.json locks the version of the dependencies so in producttion we know exact version . So with the use of package.json and package-lock.json we can regenerate the node_modukes.So we dont need to push the node_modules to git.
- Whatever we can regenerate do not put up on the git.only have essential things on git.


To host : 
run npx parcel index.html
parcel creates a server for us and then runs the project on that server
What is npx: executing a package --> npx packagename
What is npm: installing a package


Ways to include react :
1.CDN --> not a preferred Way
--> fetching from cdn is expensive (network call)
--> everytime version changes url needs to be changed/

2.Npm

--> Already in the node_modukes (no network call and quicker)

Installing react : npm i react
Install react-dom : npm i react-dom

What all parcel does ? :
- dev build
- Local server
- HMR
- Caching - Faster builds
- File wathcing algorithm
- Image optimization
- Minification
- Bundling
- Compressing
- Consistent hashing
- Code splitting
- Differential bundling - support older brwosers
- Diagnostic
- Error handling
- Host on HTTPS
- Tree shaking - remove unused code.
- Different dev and prod bundles


Creating a prod build :
npx parcel build index.html

NOTE: remove "main": "App.js" from package.json. as we are givingn the entry point in the command itself there is no need of this.

Episode 3: 

npx parcel index.html (this command executes a npm package called parcel and runs the project on the server file index.html.)

React Elements: : It is an object not a DOM element.
--> React.createElement("h1", {id: "heading"}, "Namaste React!"); is not a good way to create react elements.Very clumsy and complicated.

JSX : It is a Html like syntax inside which we can write JSX
